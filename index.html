        <p>Qurbani instils the same devotion and dedication within Muslims towards Allah (SWT) as the Prophet Ibrahim (AS) showed. 
          Even though the act of Qurbani itself is to bring death to the animal, the actual meaning is about life. 
          It is meant to teach Muslims restraint, obedience to Allah (SWT), devotion to righteousness, and Taqwa.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, Qurbani serves as an important means to both remember and provide for the most vulnerable in our communities, 
          ensuring they are not left excluded from community-wide celebrations. By sacrificing an animal during the Eid ul-Adha festivities, 
          Qurbani brings the entire Ummah together.</p></div>
